## 👷 Developing

1. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   bun install
   ```

2. Start the development server

   ```sh
   bun run dev
   ```

### ⚒️ Building

1. Build the site

   ```sh
   bun run build
   ```

2. Preview the built site

   ```sh
   bun run preview
   ```

### 🐳 Deployment

This site can be deployed to a Docker container.
The port is exposed on `8443`.

```sh
# Run on this shell
docker compose up
# or run in background
docker compose up -d
```

If you want to deploy statically via GitHub pages, Cloudflare pages, or similar, modify [astro.config.mjs](./astro.config.mjs) to remove the adapter for Node.js:

```diff
     },
-    adapter: node({
-        mode: 'middleware',
-    }),
     // ...
```

The `dist/` directory can then be served statically.
